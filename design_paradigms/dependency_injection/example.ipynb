    "# Dependency Injection\n",

    "Dependency injection is a design pattern in which an object or function recieves another object or function that it depends on.  Dependency injection aims to separate the concerns of object definition and use, allowing a piece of code which requires some outside functionality to know nothing about the dependent implementation and instead just use the functionality.  \n",

Here you'll see one of the major draw-backs to this approach where the coder must: 1) get the string correct in order to save a file as they expect, 2) know the formats which are supported, 3) maintain the multiple saving options as part of their data processing code (not ideal separation of concerns)."
