    "### Why would you use environment variables?\n",
    "A common use-case for environment variables is to pass information from a parent process\n",
    "to processes spawned by the parent.  For example, you may want to pass around a unique token\n",
    "generated by a parent process to be used by child processes to write information to a specific\n",
    "location.  In this example, you could set an environment variable in the parent process, and then\n",
    "by virtue of using something like `Jobmon` that environmental information will be automatically\n",
    "passed to the child processes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One warning when defining your own environment variables is that they only exist for the lifespan\n",
    "of whatever process placed it into the environment.  This means that they are not well suited\n",
    "for storing information long-term, or keeping records of previous values.  It is best to use\n",
    "environment variables sparingly, and to prefer explicitly passing information via a command-line\n",
